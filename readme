Dots and Boxes, complete (hopefully) with AI.

Object of the board game
Take more boxes than your opponent. You move by connecting two dots with a line.
When you place the last ‘wall’ of a single square (box), the box is yours.
The players move in turn, but whenever a player takes a box (s)he must move again.
The board game ends when all 25 boxes have been taken. The player with the most boxes wins.

Connecting dots
You connect two dots by clicking on the line between them. 

Taking boxes
When all four of the lines around a single box are in place, the player who made the last move owns the box.
The box is marked in that player’s color and (s)he must move again.

End of the board game
The game is finished when all connections have been made and all boxes have been taken. The player who owns most boxes wins.
